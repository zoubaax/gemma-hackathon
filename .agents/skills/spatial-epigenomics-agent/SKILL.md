# Spatial Epigenomics Agent

The **Spatial Epigenomics Agent** analyzes spatial epigenomic data combining chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq), histone modifications (CUT&Tag), and DNA methylation with spatial coordinates. It maps regulatory landscapes across tissue architecture to understand cell-state regulation in spatial context.

## When to Use This Skill

* When analyzing spatial ATAC-seq data (Slide-seq + ATAC, DBiT-seq).
* To map chromatin accessibility across tissue microenvironments.
* For spatial profiling of histone modifications (H3K27ac, H3K4me3, H3K27me3).
* When integrating spatial epigenomics with spatial transcriptomics.
* To identify spatially-variable regulatory elements and enhancers.

## Core Capabilities

1. **Spatial ATAC Analysis**: Process spatial chromatin accessibility data to identify open chromatin regions with spatial coordinates.

2. **Spatial CUT&Tag**: Analyze spatially-resolved histone modification profiles (H3K27ac for enhancers, H3K4me3 for promoters).

3. **Spatial Methylation**: Map DNA methylation patterns across tissue sections using spatial bisulfite methods.

4. **Multi-Modal Integration**: Combine spatial epigenomics with spatial transcriptomics for regulatory network inference.

5. **Regulatory Element Mapping**: Identify spatially-variable enhancers, promoters, and silencers.

6. **3D Chromatin Organization**: Integrate with MERFISH/seqFISH+ for spatial chromatin organization.

## Technologies Supported

| Technology | Epigenetic Mark | Resolution | Method |
|------------|-----------------|------------|--------|
| Spatial-ATAC-seq | Open chromatin | ~10-50μm | Microfluidic barcoding |
| DBiT-seq | ATAC + expression | ~10μm | Deterministic barcoding |
| Spatial-CUT&Tag | Histone marks | ~50μm | Cleavage under targets |
| Spatial-MethylSeq | DNA methylation | Variable | Bisulfite conversion |
| MERFISH + epigenetics | 3D organization | Single-cell | Imaging-based |

## Workflow

1. **Input**: Spatial epigenomics data (BAM files + spatial coordinates) or processed peak matrices.

2. **Preprocessing**: Alignment, deduplication, peak calling with spatial awareness.

3. **Spatial Clustering**: Identify spatial domains with similar epigenetic profiles.

4. **Peak Annotation**: Map peaks to genomic features (promoters, enhancers, gene bodies).

5. **Motif Analysis**: Identify transcription factor binding motifs in spatially-variable peaks.

6. **Integration**: Combine with expression data for regulatory inference.

7. **Output**: Spatial peak maps, regulatory networks, domain annotations.

## Example Usage

**User**: "Analyze this spatial ATAC-seq dataset to identify spatially-variable regulatory elements in the tumor microenvironment."
