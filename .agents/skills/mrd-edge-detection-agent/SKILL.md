# MRD-EDGE Detection Agent

The **MRD-EDGE Detection Agent** implements the MRD-EDGE (Enhanced Detection of ctDNA through Genomic Error suppression) deep learning algorithm for ultra-sensitive molecular residual disease detection. This AI-powered approach achieves unprecedented sensitivity in predicting cancer recurrence, detecting ctDNA at levels below 0.001% VAF with zero false negatives in validation studies.

## When to Use This Skill

* When standard ctDNA assays show negative but MRD is suspected.
* For ultra-sensitive post-surgical MRD monitoring.
* To detect relapse at the earliest possible timepoint.
* When monitoring therapy response in minimal disease settings.
* For research studies requiring highest sensitivity MRD detection.

## Core Capabilities

1. **Ultra-Sensitive Detection**: Detect ctDNA at 0.0001-0.001% VAF levels.

2. **Deep Learning Error Suppression**: AI-powered sequencing error filtering.

3. **Integrated Noise Modeling**: Patient-specific background noise estimation.

4. **Multi-Feature Integration**: Combine mutations, fragmentation, methylation.

5. **Zero False Negative Design**: Optimized for sensitivity while controlling specificity.

6. **Longitudinal Tracking**: Monitor MRD over time with confidence intervals.

## MRD-EDGE Algorithm Components

| Component | Function | Improvement |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| Error Suppression Network | Deep learning noise filter | 10x sensitivity |
| Duplex Consensus | UMI-based error correction | 100x error reduction |
| Fragment Analysis | Tumor fragment enrichment | 2-3x signal boost |
| Integration Model | Multi-feature Bayesian fusion | Improved accuracy |

## Sensitivity Comparison

| Method | LOD (VAF) | False Negative Rate |
|--------|-----------|---------------------|
| Standard NGS | 1% | High |
| UMI-corrected | 0.1% | Moderate |
| Tumor-informed panels | 0.01% | Low |
| MRD-EDGE | 0.001% | Near-zero |

## Workflow

1. **Input**: Deep sequenced cfDNA (>30,000x), tumor WES, matched normal.

2. **Preprocessing**: UMI deduplication, duplex consensus, quality filtering.

3. **Noise Modeling**: Patient-specific error profile estimation.

4. **Feature Extraction**: Mutations, fragments, methylation signals.

5. **Deep Learning Inference**: MRD-EDGE neural network prediction.

6. **Bayesian Integration**: Combine features with uncertainty.

7. **Output**: MRD probability, detected variants, confidence intervals.

## Example Usage

**User**: "Run MRD-EDGE analysis on this post-surgical colorectal cancer patient's plasma sample."

## AI/ML Components

**Error Suppression Network**:

**Bayesian Integration**:
- Prior from tumor mutational burden
- Likelihood from detected signals
- Posterior probability of MRD

**Training Strategy**:
- Semi-supervised with spike-in controls
- Hard negative mining from CHIP
- Transfer learning across cancer types

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.10+
* PyTorch 2.0+
* UMI-tools, fgbio for UMI processing
* bcftools, samtools
* MRD-EDGE model weights
* High-memory compute (>64GB RAM)
* GPU recommended

* Tumor_Heterogeneity_Agent - Clonal tracking

## Quality Control Metrics

| Metric | Threshold | Interpretation |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| Mean Coverage | >30,000x | Sensitivity adequate |
| Duplex Rate | >20% | Error suppression possible |
| cfDNA Input | >30ng | Sufficient material |
| Tumor Mutations Tracked | >10 | Robust detection |
| Background Noise | <0.001% | Specificity maintained |

## Special Considerations

1. **Sample Quality**: Requires high-quality cfDNA extraction
2. **Sequencing Depth**: Deep sequencing essential for sensitivity
3. **CHIP Exclusion**: Must filter clonal hematopoiesis variants
4. **Tumor Heterogeneity**: Track clonal and subclonal mutations
5. **Timing**: Sample >2 weeks post-surgery for clearance

## Clinical Decision Support

| MRD-EDGE Result | Recommended Action |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| MRD+ (high confidence) | Consider adjuvant therapy |
| MRD+ (low confidence) | Repeat testing in 4-6 weeks |
| MRD- (high confidence) | Surveillance per guidelines |
| MRD- (low confidence) | Consider repeat testing |
