# PopEVE Variant Predictor Agent

The **PopEVE Variant Predictor Agent** leverages the PopEVE deep learning model from Harvard Medical School to predict pathogenicity of genetic variants. PopEVE analyzes evolutionary conservation, protein structure, and population frequency to identify disease-causing variants, having identified over 100 previously unrecognized variants responsible for undiagnosed rare genetic diseases.

## When to Use This Skill

* When predicting pathogenicity of missense variants genome-wide.
* For rare disease diagnosis with variants of uncertain significance (VUS).
* To prioritize candidate variants in exome/genome sequencing.
* When interpreting novel variants not in ClinVar or literature.
* For population-stratified variant interpretation.

## Core Capabilities

1. **Pathogenicity Prediction**: Score any missense variant for disease likelihood.

2. **VUS Resolution**: Reclassify variants of uncertain significance.

3. **Rare Disease Diagnosis**: Identify causal variants in undiagnosed patients.

4. **Population-Aware Scoring**: Account for ancestry-specific variant frequencies.

5. **Protein Context Analysis**: Integrate structural and functional domains.

6. **Batch Variant Scoring**: Process thousands of variants efficiently.

## Model Architecture

| Component | Description | Data Source |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Evolutionary Module | Deep sequence alignment | UniRef90, 250M seqs |
| Structural Module | AlphaFold2 structures | 200M+ structures |
| Population Module | gnomAD frequencies | 800K+ individuals |
| Clinical Module | ClinVar training | 100K+ classifications |
| Integration | Multi-task neural network | Combined features |

## Scoring Thresholds

| PopEVE Score | Interpretation | Suggested Action |
|--------------|----------------|------------------|
| > 0.9 | Likely Pathogenic | High priority |
| 0.7 - 0.9 | Possibly Pathogenic | Review carefully |
| 0.3 - 0.7 | Uncertain | Additional evidence needed |
| 0.1 - 0.3 | Possibly Benign | Lower priority |
| < 0.1 | Likely Benign | Deprioritize |

## Workflow

1. **Input**: VCF file, gene list, or individual variants.

2. **Annotation**: Map variants to transcripts and proteins.

3. **Feature Extraction**: Compute evolutionary, structural, population features.

4. **Prediction**: Run PopEVE model for pathogenicity scores.

5. **Population Adjustment**: Apply ancestry-specific calibration.

6. **Ranking**: Prioritize variants by score and gene relevance.

7. **Output**: Scored variants with interpretations.

## Example Usage

**User**: "Score all missense variants from this rare disease patient's exome to identify potential causal variants."

**Agent Action**:
```bash
python3 Skills/Genomics/PopEVE_Variant_Predictor_Agent/popeve_predict.py \
    --vcf patient_exome.vcf \
    --genome GRCh38 \
    --ancestry EUR \
    --gene_panel rare_disease_genes.txt \
    --min_score 0.5 \
    --output pathogenicity_scores.tsv
```

## Input Formats

| Format | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| VCF | Standard variant calls | patient.vcf.gz |
| TSV | Simple variant list | chr, pos, ref, alt |
| HGVS | Protein notation | NP_000546.1:p.Arg248Gln |
| Gene + Position | Gene-centric | TP53:R248Q |

## Output Components

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Variant | Genomic/protein notation |
| PopEVE_Score | 0-1 pathogenicity score |
| Classification | Benign/VUS/Pathogenic |
| Confidence | Prediction confidence |
| EVE_Score | Evolutionary component |
| Structure_Score | Structural impact |
| Population_AF | Population frequency |
| Gene | Affected gene |
| Domain | Protein domain affected |
| ClinVar | Existing classification if any |

## Comparison with Other Tools

| Tool | PopEVE Advantage |
|------|------------------|
| SIFT/PolyPhen | More accurate, deep learning |
| CADD | Population-aware, less bias |
| REVEL | Better rare variant handling |
| AlphaMissense | Complimentary; can ensemble |
| ClinVar | Scores novel variants |

## AI/ML Components

**Deep Learning Architecture**:
- Transformer for sequence context
- Graph neural network for structure
- Variational autoencoder for evolution
- Gradient boosting for integration

**Training Strategy**:
- Semi-supervised with ClinVar labels
- Evolutionary likelihood (unsupervised)
- Population frequency calibration
- Cross-validation across genes

**Population Modeling**:
- Ancestry-specific allele frequencies
- Selection coefficient estimation
- Demographic history modeling

## Performance Metrics

| Metric | PopEVE | AlphaMissense | REVEL |
|--------|--------|---------------|-------|
| AUROC (ClinVar) | 0.95 | 0.94 | 0.92 |
| AUROC (DMS) | 0.89 | 0.90 | 0.85 |
| VUS Resolution | 45% | 40% | 35% |
| Cross-ancestry | 0.93 | 0.91 | 0.88 |

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.10+
* PyTorch, transformers
* PopEVE model weights
* Reference genome (GRCh37/38)
* VEP or similar annotator
* gnomAD database access

## Related Skills

* AlphaMissense_Agent - For AlphaMissense predictions
* DiagAI_Agent - For clinical diagnosis support
* ACMG_Classifier_Agent - For ACMG classification
* Pharmacogenomics_Agent - For drug-gene variants

## Disease Categories

| Category | Example Genes | PopEVE Performance |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| Cardiomyopathy | MYH7, MYBPC3 | Excellent |
| Neurological | SCN1A, KCNQ2 | Excellent |
| Cancer Predisposition | BRCA1, TP53 | Good-Excellent |
| Metabolic | PAH, CFTR | Good |
| Immunodeficiency | BTK, WAS | Good |

## Special Considerations

1. **Gene Coverage**: Best for well-conserved genes with orthologs
2. **Protein-Coding Only**: Missense variants in coding regions
3. **Novel Genes**: Lower confidence for poorly characterized genes
4. **Ancestry Calibration**: Use appropriate population reference
5. **Ensemble Approach**: Combine with AlphaMissense for best results

## Clinical Integration

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Run PopEVE on all coding variants |
| 2 | Filter by phenotype-relevant genes |
| 3 | Rank by PopEVE score |
| 4 | Review top candidates |
| 5 | Apply ACMG criteria with PopEVE as evidence |
| 6 | Validate with functional studies if available |
