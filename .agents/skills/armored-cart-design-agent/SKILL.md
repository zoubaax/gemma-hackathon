# Armored CAR-T Design Agent

The **Armored CAR-T Design Agent** provides AI-assisted design of next-generation armored CAR-T cells engineered to express cytokines, chemokines, or other enhancing factors. These armored T cells overcome solid tumor challenges including immunosuppressive TME, poor trafficking, and T cell exhaustion, with recent clinical success in lymphoma (IL-18) and ongoing trials with IL-12, IL-15, and IL-7.

## When to Use This Skill

* When designing CAR-T cells for solid tumor applications.
* For selecting optimal armoring payloads (cytokines, chemokines).
* To optimize cytokine expression levels and regulation.
* When engineering safety switches for armored constructs.
* For predicting armored CAR-T efficacy and safety profiles.

## Core Capabilities

1. **Armoring Payload Selection**: Choose optimal cytokines for tumor type.

2. **Expression Level Optimization**: Balance efficacy vs toxicity.

3. **Inducible System Design**: Engineer regulated expression systems.

4. **Safety Switch Integration**: Design kill switches and controls.

5. **Construct Optimization**: Optimize transgene configuration.

6. **Efficacy Prediction**: Predict enhanced tumor killing.

## Armoring Strategies

| Cytokine | Mechanism | Clinical Status | Tumor Types |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|-------------|
| IL-12 | Th1 polarization, IFN-gamma | Phase I/II | Solid tumors |
| IL-15 | T/NK persistence | Phase I/II | Hematologic, solid |
| IL-18 | Inflammasome, IFN-gamma | Phase I (promising) | Lymphoma |
| IL-7 | T cell survival | Phase I | Multiple |
| IL-21 | T cell proliferation | Preclinical | Multiple |
| CCL19/21 | T cell trafficking | Preclinical | Solid tumors |

## Construct Architecture Options

| Component | Options | Consideration |
|-----------|---------|---------------|
| Promoter | EF1a, PGK, CAG, NFAT-inducible | Expression level/timing |
| Signal Peptide | Native, IL-2ss, IgK | Secretion efficiency |
| Cytokine | Membrane-bound vs secreted | Local vs systemic |
| Linker | T2A, P2A, IRES | Co-expression efficiency |
| Kill Switch | iCasp9, HSV-TK, CD20 | Safety control |
| Position | Before/after CAR | Expression balance |

## Workflow

1. **Input**: Target tumor type, TME characteristics, CAR design.

2. **Payload Selection**: Rank armoring strategies for tumor context.

3. **Expression Design**: Optimize promoter, levels, regulation.

4. **Safety Engineering**: Add appropriate control switches.

5. **Construct Assembly**: Generate optimized DNA sequence.

6. **Efficacy Prediction**: Model enhanced killing and persistence.

7. **Output**: Optimized armored CAR construct with annotations.

## Example Usage
