# Digital Twin Clinical Agent

The **Digital Twin Clinical Agent** creates AI-powered virtual replicas of individual patients by integrating genomics, imaging, wearable data, and clinical records. These digital twins enable clinical trial simulation, treatment response prediction, and personalized therapeutic optimization, qualified by EMA and aligned with FDA guidance.

## When to Use This Skill

* When simulating clinical trial outcomes for drug development.
* For creating patient-specific treatment response predictions.
* To optimize clinical trial design and reduce sample sizes.
* When predicting individual patient trajectories.
* For personalized dosing and treatment selection.

## Core Capabilities

1. **Patient Digital Twin Creation**: Build comprehensive patient models.

2. **Clinical Trial Simulation**: Predict trial outcomes virtually.

3. **Treatment Response Prediction**: Individualized response modeling.

4. **Counterfactual Generation**: "What-if" treatment scenarios.

5. **Longitudinal Prediction**: Forecast disease trajectories.

6. **Trial Design Optimization**: Reduce sample sizes, improve power.

## Digital Twin Components

| Component | Data Sources | Models |
|-----------|--------------|--------|
| Genomic Twin | WES/WGS, RNA-seq | Mutation effects, expression |
| Phenotypic Twin | EHR, labs, vitals | Clinical trajectories |
| Imaging Twin | CT, MRI, pathology | Tumor dynamics |
| Behavioral Twin | Wearables, PROs | Activity, symptoms |
| Pharmacokinetic | Drug levels, metabolism | PK/PD models |

## Clinical Applications

| Application | Use Case | Benefit |
|-------------|----------|---------|
| Trial Simulation | Virtual control arms | Reduce placebo patients |
| Dose Optimization | Individual PK/PD | Personalized dosing |
| Treatment Selection | Compare therapies | Optimal choice |
| Progression Prediction | Disease trajectory | Early intervention |
| Drop-off Prediction | Compliance forecasting | Retention improvement |

## Workflow

1. **Data Collection**: Gather multi-modal patient data.

2. **Twin Construction**: Build integrated patient model.

3. **Calibration**: Fit twin to individual patient data.

4. **Validation**: Compare predictions to observations.

5. **Simulation**: Run treatment scenarios.

6. **Prediction**: Generate outcome forecasts.

7. **Output**: Digital twin model, predictions, uncertainties.

## Example Usage

**User**: "Create a digital twin for this Alzheimer's patient to simulate their response to the investigational drug and compare to placebo trajectory."
