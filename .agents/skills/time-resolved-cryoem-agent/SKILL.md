# Time-Resolved Cryo-EM Agent

The **Time-Resolved Cryo-EM Agent** leverages time-resolved cryo-electron microscopy to capture protein dynamics, drug-binding kinetics, and conformational transitions. It integrates AI-powered analysis with experimental time-resolved data to enable dynamics-based drug discovery, moving beyond static structures to understand drug mechanisms in motion.

## When to Use This Skill

* When studying drug-binding kinetics structurally.
* For capturing protein conformational transitions.
* To understand allosteric mechanisms and dynamics.
* When designing drugs targeting specific conformational states.
* For characterizing enzyme catalytic cycles.

## Core Capabilities

1. **Kinetics Extraction**: Extract binding kinetics from time-resolved data.

2. **Conformational Sorting**: Classify particles by conformational state.

3. **Trajectory Reconstruction**: Build conformational trajectories.

4. **Intermediate Identification**: Detect rare intermediate states.

5. **MD Integration**: Combine with molecular dynamics simulations.

6. **Dynamics-Based Design**: Design drugs targeting specific states.

## Workflow

1. **Input**: Time-resolved cryo-EM datasets, protein sequence.

2. **Particle Processing**: 3D classification across timepoints.

3. **State Assignment**: AI-powered conformational sorting.

4. **Kinetics Fitting**: Extract rate constants.

5. **Intermediate Mapping**: Identify transient states.

6. **Drug Design**: Target state-specific pockets.

7. **Output**: Kinetic models, conformational movie, design targets.

## Special Considerations

1. **Sample Consumption**: Time-resolved requires more sample
2. **Synchronization**: Initiation must be well-controlled
3. **Resolution Trade-off**: Fewer particles per timepoint
4. **Intermediate Lifetime**: Must match experimental timescale
5. **Data Quality**: Requires high-quality data collection
