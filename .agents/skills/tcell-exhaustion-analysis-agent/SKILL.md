# T-Cell Exhaustion Analysis Agent

The **T-Cell Exhaustion Analysis Agent** provides comprehensive profiling of T-cell dysfunction states in cancer and chronic infection. It analyzes exhaustion signatures, identifies stem-like progenitor populations, characterizes epigenetic scarring, and predicts checkpoint immunotherapy response.

## When to Use This Skill

* When profiling tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) exhaustion states from scRNA-seq data.
* To identify stem-like exhausted T-cells (Tex-prog) that predict checkpoint blockade response.
* For analyzing epigenetic exhaustion programs via ATAC-seq or CUT&Tag.
* To assess exhaustion reversal potential and re-exhaustion risk.
* When designing combination immunotherapy strategies.

## Core Capabilities

1. **Exhaustion State Classification**: Distinguishes progenitor exhausted (Tex-prog), intermediate, and terminally exhausted (Tex-term) populations using transcriptional signatures.

2. **Stem-like T-Cell Detection**: Identifies TCF1+ stem-like exhausted cells that sustain anti-tumor immunity and respond to PD-1 blockade.

3. **Epigenetic Scarring Analysis**: Characterizes chromatin accessibility patterns that maintain exhaustion programs despite checkpoint blockade.

4. **Checkpoint Expression Profiling**: Quantifies inhibitory receptors (PD-1, TIM-3, LAG-3, TIGIT, CTLA-4) at single-cell resolution.

5. **Response Prediction**: Machine learning models predict checkpoint blockade response based on exhaustion profiles.

6. **TME Interaction Analysis**: Maps suppressive cell interactions (Tregs, MDSCs, TAMs) promoting exhaustion.

## Exhaustion Signatures

**Progenitor Exhausted (Tex-prog)**:
- TCF1+, SLAMF6+, PD-1+
- Self-renewal capacity
- Proliferative burst upon checkpoint blockade
- Good prognosis marker

**Terminal Exhausted (Tex-term)**:
- TCF1-, TIM-3+, CD39+
- Effector-like but dysfunctional
- Limited proliferative potential
- Epigenetically fixed exhaustion

## Workflow

1. **Input**: scRNA-seq, CITE-seq, or scATAC-seq data from TILs or PBMCs.

2. **Preprocessing**: Quality control, normalization, batch correction.

3. **Clustering**: Identify T-cell subsets and exhaustion states.

4. **Signature Scoring**: Apply exhaustion gene signatures (TOX, NR4A, NFAT targets).

5. **Epigenetic Analysis**: Assess chromatin accessibility at exhaustion loci.

6. **Prediction**: Model checkpoint response from exhaustion profiles.

7. **Output**: Exhaustion state proportions, stem-like cell fractions, response predictions.

## Example Usage

**User**: "Analyze T-cell exhaustion states in this TIL scRNA-seq dataset and predict anti-PD-1 response."

**Agent Action**:
```bash
python3 Skills/Immunology_Vaccines/TCell_Exhaustion_Analysis_Agent/exhaustion_analyzer.py \
    --input til_scrnaseq.h5ad \
    --tcells CD8A+CD3E+ \
    --signatures exhaustion_signatures.gmt \
    --epigenetic til_scatacseq.h5ad \
    --predict_response true \
    --output exhaustion_report/
```

## Key Markers and Genes

| Category | Markers | Role |
|----------|---------|------|
| Exhaustion TFs | TOX, TOX2, NR4A1-3 | Exhaustion program drivers |
| Stem-like | TCF7 (TCF1), LEF1, SLAMF6 | Progenitor maintenance |
| Terminal | HAVCR2 (TIM-3), ENTPD1 (CD39), LAYN | Terminal exhaustion |
| Checkpoints | PDCD1, CTLA4, LAG3, TIGIT | Inhibitory receptors |
| Effector | GZMB, PRF1, IFNG | Cytotoxic function |

## Epigenetic Exhaustion Program

The exhaustion epigenetic landscape is largely resistant to checkpoint blockade:

* **Stable open chromatin** at exhaustion-associated genes (TOX, NR4A, checkpoint loci)
* **Epigenetic scars** maintained even after PD-1 therapy
* **Re-exhaustion** occurs upon cessation of checkpoint blockade
* **Therapeutic implications**: Epigenetic modifiers may enhance durability

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.10+
* Scanpy/Seurat for scRNA-seq
* ArchR/Signac for scATAC-seq
* CellTypist or custom classifiers

## Related Skills

* CAR_T_Design - For engineering exhaustion-resistant CAR-T cells
* Immune_Repertoire_Analysis - For TCR clonotype tracking
* Tumor_Microenvironment - For TIL context analysis

## Clinical Implications

1. **Patient Selection**: High stem-like Tex predicts checkpoint response
2. **Combination Therapy**: TIGIT + PD-1 for resistant tumors
3. **Epigenetic Therapy**: DNMT/HDAC inhibitors to reprogram exhausted cells
4. **CAR-T Engineering**: TOX knockout to prevent CAR-T exhaustion
