# Multi-Ancestry PRS Agent

The **Multi-Ancestry PRS Agent** provides AI-optimized polygenic risk score calculation designed to work across diverse ancestral populations. It addresses the critical limitation of European-biased GWAS by integrating trans-ancestry methods, improving risk prediction for underrepresented populations and enabling equitable precision medicine.

## When to Use This Skill

* When calculating PRS for non-European ancestry individuals.
* For developing trans-ancestry risk prediction models.
* To reduce PRS bias across ancestral populations.
* When integrating multi-ancestry GWAS summary statistics.
* For research on PRS portability and equity.

## Core Capabilities

1. **Multi-Ancestry PRS**: Calculate ancestry-aware polygenic scores.

2. **Trans-Ancestry Optimization**: Optimize weights across populations.

3. **Local Ancestry Integration**: Account for admixed genomes.

4. **Ensemble Methods**: Combine multiple PRS approaches.

5. **Ancestry Calibration**: Population-specific score calibration.

6. **Equity Assessment**: Evaluate prediction fairness across groups.

## Supported Ancestries

| Ancestry | Training Data Availability | PRS Performance |
|----------|---------------------------|-----------------|
| European (EUR) | Excellent | High |
| East Asian (EAS) | Good | Good |
| South Asian (SAS) | Moderate | Moderate |
| African (AFR) | Limited | Lower |
| Hispanic/Latino (AMR) | Limited | Variable |
| Middle Eastern (MID) | Very Limited | Lower |

## Multi-Ancestry Methods

| Method | Approach | Best For |
|--------|----------|----------|
| PRS-CSx | Cross-population shrinkage | Multi-ancestry |
| PRS-Multi | Multi-population training | Large cohorts |
| Ensemble | Combined methods | Best overall |
| Local Ancestry | Ancestry-specific weights | Admixed populations |
| GPSMult | Integrated multi-trait | Correlated traits |

## Workflow

1. **Input**: Individual genotypes, target ancestry, disease/trait.

2. **Ancestry Inference**: Determine genetic ancestry.

3. **Method Selection**: Choose optimal PRS approach.

4. **Score Calculation**: Compute ancestry-aware PRS.

5. **Calibration**: Apply population-specific calibration.

6. **Risk Stratification**: Categorize into risk groups.

7. **Output**: PRS, percentile, clinical interpretation.

## Example Usage

**User**: "Calculate multi-ancestry coronary artery disease PRS for this admixed individual with African and European ancestry."

**Agent Action**:
```bash
python3 Skills/Precision_Medicine/Multi_Ancestry_PRS_Agent/calc_prs.py \
    --genotypes patient_genotypes.vcf.gz \
    --ancestry admixed_AFR_EUR \
    --local_ancestry lai_segments.bed \
    --trait coronary_artery_disease \
    --method prs_csx \
    --gwas_summary_stats eur_gwas.txt,afr_gwas.txt \
    --calibration_cohort 1kg_admixed \
    --output prs_results/
```

## Bias and Fairness

| Bias Type | Cause | Mitigation |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| Discovery Bias | EUR-dominated GWAS | Multi-ancestry GWAS |
| LD Variation | Population-specific LD | Local ancestry adjustment |
| Allele Frequency | Differing frequencies | Population-specific weights |
| Effect Size | Heterogeneous effects | Trans-ancestry meta-analysis |

## Large-Scale Initiatives

| Initiative | Focus | Contribution |
|------------|-------|--------------|
| All of Us | US diversity | 1M diverse participants |
| PAGE | Multi-ethnic GWAS | Discovery in diverse |
| H3Africa | African genomics | Continental diversity |
| Mexican Biobank | Latin American | Admixed populations |
| GBMI | Global Biobank | Multi-ancestry meta-analysis |

## Special Considerations

1. **Self-Reported Ancestry**: May not match genetic ancestry
2. **Admixture**: Require local ancestry methods
3. **Population Stratification**: Careful covariate adjustment
4. **Clinical Validity**: Validate in target population
5. **Health Equity**: Consider access disparities
