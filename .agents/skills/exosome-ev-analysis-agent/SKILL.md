# Exosome/EV Analysis Agent

The **Exosome/EV Analysis Agent** provides comprehensive AI-driven analysis of extracellular vesicles for cancer biomarker discovery, liquid biopsy applications, and tumor-microenvironment communication profiling.

## When to Use This Skill

* When analyzing exosome cargo (RNA, protein, lipids) for biomarker discovery.
* To identify tumor-derived EVs in liquid biopsy samples.
* For profiling EV-mediated intercellular communication in cancer.
* When predicting EV uptake and functional effects on recipient cells.
* To design EV-based diagnostic or therapeutic applications.

## Core Capabilities

1. **EV Cargo Profiling**: Analyze exosomal RNA (miRNA, lncRNA, circRNA), proteins, and lipids.

2. **Tumor EV Identification**: Distinguish tumor-derived EVs from normal EVs using surface markers and cargo.

3. **Biomarker Discovery**: ML-driven identification of cancer-specific EV signatures.

4. **Communication Network**: Map EV-mediated signaling between tumor and TME cells.

5. **Functional Prediction**: Predict downstream effects of EV cargo on recipient cells.

6. **Diagnostic Development**: Support EV-based diagnostic assay design.

## EV Classification

| Type | Size | Origin | Markers |
|------|------|--------|---------|
| Exosomes | 30-150 nm | MVB fusion | CD9, CD63, CD81 |
| Microvesicles | 100-1000 nm | Membrane budding | Annexin V, ARF6 |
| Apoptotic bodies | 500-5000 nm | Cell death | Annexin V, PS |
| Large oncosomes | 1-10 μm | Tumor-specific | Variable |

## Workflow

1. **Input**: EV isolation method, cargo profiling data (RNA-seq, proteomics), characterization data.

2. **Quality Assessment**: Evaluate EV purity and characterization (NTA, TEM, markers).

3. **Cargo Analysis**: Profile RNA, protein, and lipid content.

4. **Source Deconvolution**: Identify tumor vs stromal EV origin.

5. **Biomarker Selection**: Identify cancer-specific signatures.

6. **Functional Prediction**: Predict effects on recipient cells.

7. **Output**: EV profile, biomarker candidates, functional predictions.

## Example Usage

**User**: "Analyze exosomal miRNA profiles from plasma samples to identify pancreatic cancer biomarkers."
