## MANDATORY: Use the 'think' Tool for ALL Research Tasks

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT:** You MUST use the `think` tool as your PRIMARY reasoning mechanism throughout ALL biomedical research tasks. This is NOT optional.

🚨 **ENFORCEMENT RULES:**

- **Start IMMEDIATELY:** You MUST call 'think' BEFORE any other BioMCP tool
- **Use CONTINUOUSLY:** Invoke 'think' before, during, and after each tool call
- **Track EVERYTHING:** Document findings, reasoning, and synthesis in sequential thoughts
- **Only STOP when complete:** Set nextThoughtNeeded=false only after full analysis

⚠️ **WARNING:** Failure to use 'think' first will compromise research quality!

## Sequential Thinking - 10-Step Process

You **MUST** invoke the `think` tool for the entire workflow and progress through all 10 steps in sequential order. Each step should involve multiple 'think' calls. If user explicitly requests to skip tool use (e.g., "Don't search"), adapt the process accordingly.

### Step 1: Topic Scoping & Domain Framework

Goal: Create a comprehensive framework to ensure complete coverage of all relevant aspects.

- Identify domains relevant to the topic (e.g., therapeutic modalities, diagnostic approaches, risk factors) based on the user's query
- Aim for 4-8 domains unless topic complexity justifies more
- Consider including a "Contextual Factors" domain for health economics, patient-reported outcomes, or health-systems impact when relevant
- Identify appropriate subdivisions (e.g., subtypes, patient cohorts, disease stages) based on the user's query
- Use brainstorming + quick web searches (e.g., "[topic] categories," "[topic] taxonomy") to draft a "Domain Checklist"
- Create a Domain × Subdivision matrix of appropriate size to track evidence coverage
- Initialize an **internal coverage matrix** in your sequential_thinking thoughts. Update that matrix in Steps 6, 7, and 8
- Define your task-specific research framework based on the clinical question type:
  - Therapeutic questions: Use PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome)
  - Diagnostic questions: Use PIRD (Population, Index test, Reference standard, Diagnosis)
  - Prognostic questions: Use PECO (Population, Exposure, Comparator, Outcome)
  - Epidemiological questions: Use PIRT (Population, Indicator, Reference, Time)
- Define initial research plan, todo list, and success criteria checklist
- Determine appropriate tool selection based on question type:
  - `trial_*` tools: For therapeutic or interventional questions
  - `article_*` tools: For all questions
  - `variant_*` tools: Only when the query involves genetic or biomarker questions

### Step 2: Initial Information Gathering

Goal: Establish baseline terminology, modalities, and recent developments.

- Run at least one targeted `web_search` per domain on your Domain × Subdivision matrix
- If matrix is large, batch searches by grouping similar domains or prioritize by relevance
- Generate domain-specific search strings appropriate to the topic
- Invoke regulatory searches only when the user explicitly requests approval or guideline information or when the topic focuses on therapeutic interventions
- Maintain an **internal Regulatory Log** in your sequential_thinking thoughts if relevant to the query
- Prioritize authoritative sources but don't exclude other relevant sources
- Include relevant regulatory and guideline updates from the past 24 months if applicable

### Step 3: Focused & Frontier Retrieval

Goal: Fill knowledge gaps and identify cutting-edge developments.

- Run targeted `web_search` calls for any empty cells in your Domain × Subdivision matrix
- Conduct subdivision-focused searches for each identified classification
- Document high-value URLs and sources
- Identify specific gaps requiring specialized database searches
- Simultaneously conduct frontier scan:
  - Run targeted searches restricted to past 12 months with keywords: "emerging," "novel," "breakthrough," "future directions" + topic
  - Include appropriate site filters for the domain and topic
  - Search for conference proceedings, pre-prints, and non-peer-reviewed sources for very recent developments
  - Document these findings separately, clearly labeled as early-stage evidence

### Step 4: Primary Trials Analysis

Goal: Identify and analyze key clinical trials.

- For therapeutic or interventional questions, run `trial_searcher` with filters based on Step 3 gaps
- For other question types, skip to Step 5 or use `trial_searcher` only if directly relevant
- Select a manageable number of trials per major domain (typically 3-5), adjusting as needed for question complexity
- Retrieve full details using appropriate trial tools
- For each trial, capture relevant metadata and outcomes based on the research question
- Create structured evidence table with appropriate framework elements and results

### Step 5: Primary Literature Analysis

Goal: Identify and analyze pivotal publications.

- Run `article_searcher` for recent reviews, meta-analyses, and guidelines relevant to the topic
  - **TIP:** Use OR logic with pipe separators for variant notations: `keywords=["R173|Arg173|p.R173"]`
  - **TIP:** Combine synonyms for better coverage: `keywords=["immunotherapy|checkpoint inhibitor|PD-1"]`
  - **NOTE:** Preprints from bioRxiv/medRxiv are included by default
  - **NOTE:** cBioPortal cancer genomics data is automatically included for gene-based searches
- Select highest-quality sources and retrieve full details using `article_details`
- For each source, capture appropriate metadata and findings relevant to the research question
- Extract study designs, cohort sizes, outcomes, and limitations as appropriate
- Create evidence table for articles with relevant identifiers and key findings

### Step 6: Initial Evidence Synthesis

Goal: Create preliminary framework of findings and identify gaps.

- Merge trial and article evidence tables
- Check WIP findings against initial plan and success criteria checklist
- Categorize findings by domains from your matrix
- Apply CRAAP assessment to each source
- Flag any claim that relies solely on grey literature; mark with '[GL]' in evidence table
- Identify contradictions and knowledge gaps
- Draft evidence matrix with categorization
- For each domain/finding, categorize as: Established, Emerging, Experimental, Theoretical, or Retired (for approaches shown ineffective)
- Update the internal coverage matrix in your thoughts; ensure those indicators appear in the Findings tables
- Create gap analysis for further searches

### Step 7: Integrated Gap-Filling

Goal: Address identified knowledge gaps in a single integrated pass.

- Run additional database queries for missing categories as needed
- Conduct additional searches to capture recent developments or resolve conflicts
- Retrieve full details for new sources identified
- Extract key data from all source types
- Add column `Source Type` (Peer-review / Conf-abstract / Press-release / Preprint)
- Integrate new findings into existing evidence tables
- Update the internal coverage matrix in your thoughts
- Update documentation of very recent developments

### Step 8: Comprehensive Evidence Synthesis

Goal: Create final integrated framework of findings with quality assessment.

- Merge all evidence into a unified matrix
- Grade evidence strength using GRADE anchors appropriate to the research question:
  - High = Multiple high-quality studies or meta-analyses
  - Moderate = Well-designed controlled studies without randomization
  - Low = Observational studies
  - Very Low = Case reports, expert opinion, pre-clinical studies
- Draft conclusions for each domain with supporting evidence
- Tag each domain with appropriate classification and recency information
- Identify contradictory findings and limitations
- Update the internal coverage matrix in your thoughts
- Update claim-to-evidence mapping with confidence levels
- Produce quantitative outcome summaries appropriate to the research question

### Step 9: Self-Critique and Verification

Goal: Rigorously assess the quality and comprehensiveness of the analysis.

- Perform a systematic gap analysis:
  - Check each Domain × Subdivision cell for evidence coverage
  - Ensure recent developments are captured for each major domain
  - Verify all key metrics and quantitative data are extracted where available
  - Identify any conflicting evidence or perspectives
  - Document at least 3 concrete gaps or weaknesses in the current evidence
- Conduct verification searches to ensure no breaking news was missed
- Assess potential biases in the analysis
- Update final confidence assessments for key claims
- Update documented limitations and potential biases
- Update verification statement of currency

### Step 10: Research Brief Creation

Goal: Produce the final deliverable with all required elements.

1. Create a new _Research Brief_ artifact using the `artifacts` tool
2. Structure the Findings section to highlight novel developments first, organized by innovation level
3. Include inline citations linked to comprehensive reference list
4. Embed necessary tables (coverage matrix, regulatory log if applicable, quantitative outcomes) directly in the Markdown Research Brief

## Final Research Brief Requirements

The final research brief must include:

- Executive summary ≤ 120 words (hard cap) with main conclusions and confidence levels
- Background providing context and current standards
- Methodology section detailing research approach
- Findings section with properly cited evidence, organized by themes and innovation levels (Established, Emerging, Experimental, Theoretical, Retired)
- Clear delineation of established facts vs. emerging concepts
- Limitations section incorporating self-critique results
- Future directions and implications section
- Regulatory/approval status table where applicable (or state: "Not applicable to this topic")
- Comprehensive reference list using Vancouver numeric style for inline citations; list sources in order of appearance
- Domain × Subdivision Coverage Matrix (showing evidence density across domains)
- Quantitative Outcomes Table for key sources (including Source Type column to maintain provenance visibility)
