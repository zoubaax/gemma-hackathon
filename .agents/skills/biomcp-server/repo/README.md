# BioMCP: Biomedical Model Context Protocol

BioMCP is an open source (MIT License) toolkit that empowers AI assistants and
agents with specialized biomedical knowledge. Built following the Model Context
Protocol (MCP), it connects AI systems to authoritative biomedical data
sources, enabling them to answer questions about clinical trials, scientific
literature, and genomic variants with precision and depth.

## MCPHub Certification

BioMCP is certified by [MCPHub](https://mcphub.com/mcp-servers/genomoncology/biomcp). This certification ensures that BioMCP follows best practices for Model Context Protocol implementation and provides reliable biomedical data access.

## Why BioMCP?

While Large Language Models have broad general knowledge, they often lack
specialized domain-specific information or access to up-to-date resources.
BioMCP bridges this gap for biomedicine by:

- Providing **structured access** to clinical trials, biomedical literature,
  and genomic variants
- Enabling **natural language queries** to specialized databases without
  requiring knowledge of their specific syntax
- Supporting **biomedical research** workflows through a consistent interface
- Functioning as an **MCP server** for AI assistants and agents

## Biomedical Data Sources

BioMCP integrates with multiple biomedical data sources:

### Literature Sources

- **PubTator3/PubMed** - Peer-reviewed biomedical literature with entity annotations
- **bioRxiv/medRxiv** - Preprint servers for biology and health sciences
- **Europe PMC** - Open science platform including preprints

### Clinical & Genomic Sources

- **ClinicalTrials.gov** - Clinical trial registry and results database
- **NCI Clinical Trials Search API** - National Cancer Institute's curated cancer trials database
  - Advanced search filters (biomarkers, prior therapies, brain metastases)
  - Organization and intervention databases
  - Disease vocabulary with synonyms
- **BioThings Suite** - Comprehensive biomedical data APIs:
  - **MyVariant.info** - Consolidated genetic variant annotation
  - **MyGene.info** - Real-time gene annotations and information
  - **MyDisease.info** - Disease ontology and synonym information

- **OncoKB** - Precision oncology knowledge base for clinical variant interpretation (demo server with BRAF, ROS1, TP53)
  - Therapeutic implications and FDA-approved treatments
  - Oncogenicity and mutation effect annotations
  - Works immediately without authentication

### Regulatory & Safety Sources

- **OpenFDA** - FDA regulatory and safety data:
  - **Drug Adverse Events (FAERS)** - Post-market drug safety reports
  - **Drug Labels (SPL)** - Official prescribing information
  - **Device Events (MAUDE)** - Medical device adverse events, with genomic device filtering

## Available MCP Tools

BioMCP provides 24 specialized tools for biomedical research:

### Core Tools (3)

#### 1. Think Tool (ALWAYS USE FIRST!)

**CRITICAL**: The `think` tool MUST be your first step for ANY biomedical research task.

```python
# Start analysis with sequential thinking
think(
    thought="Breaking down the query about BRAF mutations in melanoma...",
    thoughtNumber=1,
    totalThoughts=3,
    nextThoughtNeeded=True
)
```

The sequential thinking tool helps:

- Break down complex biomedical problems systematically
- Plan multi-step research approaches
- Track reasoning progress
- Ensure comprehensive analysis

#### 2. Search Tool

The search tool supports two modes:

##### Unified Query Language (Recommended)

Use the `query` parameter with structured field syntax for powerful cross-domain searches:

```python
# Simple natural language
search(query="BRAF melanoma")

# Field-specific search
search(query="gene:BRAF AND trials.condition:melanoma")

# Complex queries
search(query="gene:BRAF AND variants.significance:pathogenic AND articles.date:>2023")

# Get searchable fields schema
search(get_schema=True)

# Explain how a query is parsed
search(query="gene:BRAF", explain_query=True)
```

**Supported Fields:**

- **Cross-domain**: `gene:`, `variant:`, `disease:`
- **Trials**: `trials.condition:`, `trials.phase:`, `trials.status:`, `trials.intervention:`
- **Articles**: `articles.author:`, `articles.journal:`, `articles.date:`
- **Variants**: `variants.significance:`, `variants.rsid:`, `variants.frequency:`

##### Domain-Based Search

Use the `domain` parameter with specific filters:

```python
# Search articles (includes automatic cBioPortal integration)
search(domain="article", genes=["BRAF"], diseases=["melanoma"])

# Search with mutation-specific cBioPortal data
search(domain="article", genes=["BRAF"], keywords=["V600E"])
search(domain="article", genes=["SRSF2"], keywords=["F57*"])  # Wildcard patterns

# Search trials
search(domain="trial", conditions=["lung cancer"], phase="3")

# Search variants
search(domain="variant", gene="TP53", significance="pathogenic")
```

**Note**: When searching articles with a gene parameter, cBioPortal data is automatically included:

- Gene-level summaries show mutation frequency across cancer studies
- Mutation-specific searches (e.g., "V600E") show study-level occurrence data
- Cancer types are dynamically resolved from cBioPortal API

#### 3. Fetch Tool

Retrieve full details for a single article, trial, or variant:

```python
# Fetch article details (supports both PMID and DOI)
fetch(domain="article", id="34567890")  # PMID
fetch(domain="article", id="10.1101/2024.01.20.23288905")  # DOI

# Fetch trial with all sections
fetch(domain="trial", id="NCT04280705", detail="all")

# Fetch variant details
fetch(domain="variant", id="rs113488022")
```

**Domain-specific options:**

- **Articles**: `detail="full"` retrieves full text if available
- **Trials**: `detail` can be "protocol", "locations", "outcomes", "references", or "all"
- **Variants**: Always returns full details

### Individual Tools (21)

For users who prefer direct access to specific functionality, BioMCP also provides 21 individual tools:

#### Article Tools (2)

- **article_searcher**: Search PubMed/PubTator3 and preprints
- **article_getter**: Fetch detailed article information (supports PMID and DOI)

#### Trial Tools (5)

- **trial_searcher**: Search ClinicalTrials.gov or NCI CTS API (via source parameter)
- **trial_getter**: Fetch all trial details from either source
- **trial_protocol_getter**: Fetch protocol information only (ClinicalTrials.gov)
- **trial_references_getter**: Fetch trial publications (ClinicalTrials.gov)
- **trial_outcomes_getter**: Fetch outcome measures and results (ClinicalTrials.gov)
- **trial_locations_getter**: Fetch site locations and contacts (ClinicalTrials.gov)

#### Variant Tools (2)

- **variant_searcher**: Search MyVariant.info database
- **variant_getter**: Fetch comprehensive variant details

#### NCI-Specific Tools (6)

- **nci_organization_searcher**: Search NCI's organization database
- **nci_organization_getter**: Get organization details by ID
- **nci_intervention_searcher**: Search NCI's intervention database (drugs, devices, procedures)
- **nci_intervention_getter**: Get intervention details by ID
- **nci_biomarker_searcher**: Search biomarkers used in trial eligibility criteria
- **nci_disease_searcher**: Search NCI's controlled vocabulary of cancer conditions

#### Gene, Disease & Drug Tools (3)

- **gene_getter**: Get real-time gene information from MyGene.info
- **disease_getter**: Get disease definitions and synonyms from MyDisease.info
- **drug_getter**: Get drug/chemical information from MyChem.info

**Note**: All individual tools that search by gene automatically include cBioPortal summaries when the `include_cbioportal` parameter is True (default). Trial searches can expand disease conditions with synonyms when `expand_synonyms` is True (default).
