# Myeloma MRD Agent

The **Myeloma MRD Agent** provides comprehensive AI-driven minimal residual disease assessment for multiple myeloma. It integrates next-generation flow cytometry (NGF), NGS-based clonotype tracking, and mass spectrometry M-protein detection for ultra-sensitive MRD monitoring.

## When to Use This Skill

* When assessing MRD status in multiple myeloma patients post-treatment.
* To select optimal MRD testing modality (NGF vs NGS vs MS).
* For predicting progression-free survival based on MRD kinetics.
* When integrating MRD with other response criteria (IMWG).
* To guide treatment intensification or de-escalation decisions.

## Core Capabilities

1. **NGF Analysis**: AI-enhanced next-generation flow cytometry for MRD detection at 10^-5 to 10^-6 sensitivity.

2. **NGS Clonotype Tracking**: Analyze IGH/IGK/IGL rearrangements for molecular MRD.

3. **Mass Spectrometry**: MALDI-TOF or LC-MS/MS for M-protein detection.

4. **Multi-Modal Integration**: Combine modalities for comprehensive MRD assessment.

5. **Kinetic Modeling**: Track MRD dynamics and predict outcomes.

6. **Response Classification**: Apply IMWG MRD criteria.

## MRD Detection Methods

| Method | Sensitivity | Sample | Advantages |
|--------|-------------|--------|------------|
| NGF (EuroFlow) | 10^-5 to 10^-6 | BM | Standardized, fast |
| NGS (clonoSEQ) | 10^-6 | BM | Ultra-sensitive |
| ASO-qPCR | 10^-5 | BM | Quantitative |
| PET-CT | N/A | Whole body | Extramedullary |
| MS (MALDI/LC-MS) | 10^-5 | Serum | Non-invasive |

## IMWG MRD Response Criteria

| Category | Definition |
|----------|------------|
| MRD-negative (10^-5) | No clonal plasma cells by NGF or NGS at 10^-5 |
| MRD-negative (10^-6) | No clonal plasma cells at 10^-6 sensitivity |
| Sustained MRD-neg | MRD-neg confirmed ≥1 year apart |
| Flow MRD-neg | NGF negative, sensitivity ≥10^-5 |
| Sequencing MRD-neg | NGS negative, sensitivity ≥10^-5 |

## Workflow

1. **Input**: Flow cytometry FCS files, NGS clonotype data, M-protein MS data, clinical parameters.

2. **NGF Analysis**: AI-assisted gating and aberrant plasma cell identification.

3. **NGS Analysis**: Clonotype frequency calculation and threshold application.

4. **MS Analysis**: M-protein peak detection and quantification.

5. **Integration**: Combine multi-modal MRD data.

6. **Kinetics**: Model MRD trajectory and predict outcomes.

7. **Output**: MRD status, response category, prognostic estimate.

## Example Usage

**User**: "Analyze MRD status for this myeloma patient using flow and NGS data."

**Agent Action**:
```bash
python3 Skills/Hematology/Myeloma_MRD_Agent/myeloma_mrd.py \
    --flow_fcs bone_marrow_ngf.fcs \
    --ngs_clonotype clonoseq_results.json \
    --ms_mprotein maldi_spectrum.csv \
    --baseline_clone diagnosis_clone.json \
    --treatment_phase post_consolidation \
    --output mrd_report.json
```

## NGF Panel (EuroFlow-Based)

**Tube 1**: CD138/CD38/CD45/CD19/CD56/CD27/CD81/CD117

**Aberrant Plasma Cell Phenotype**:
- CD138+, CD38++
- CD19- or dim (normal PC: CD19+)
- CD56+ (normal PC: CD56-)
- CD45- or dim (normal PC: CD45+)
- CD27- or dim
- CD117+ (often aberrant)

## AI-Assisted Flow Cytometry

**Automated Gating**:
- CNN-based plasma cell identification
- Aberrant vs normal PC discrimination
- Consistent quantification across samples

**Quality Control**:
- Sample adequacy assessment
- Hemodilution detection
- Event count validation

## NGS Clonotype Analysis

**Process**:
1. Identify dominant clone at diagnosis (IGH/IGK/IGL)
2. Design clone-specific assay or use multiplex (clonoSEQ)
3. Track clonal frequency in follow-up samples
4. Apply MRD threshold (typically 10^-5 or 10^-6)

**Considerations**:
- Clonal evolution may affect tracking
- Biclonal disease requires tracking both
- IGK/IGL backup if IGH fails

## Prognostic Significance

| MRD Status | PFS HR | OS HR |
|------------|--------|-------|
| MRD-neg (10^-5) | 0.35-0.45 | 0.40-0.50 |
| MRD-neg (10^-6) | 0.25-0.35 | 0.30-0.40 |
| Sustained MRD-neg | 0.20-0.30 | 0.25-0.35 |

## Clinical Decision Support

- De-escalation in sustained MRD-neg
- Intensification if MRD conversion
- Maintenance duration decisions

**Monitoring Frequency**:
- Post-induction
- Post-consolidation
- Post-transplant (Day +100)
- Every 6-12 months on maintenance
