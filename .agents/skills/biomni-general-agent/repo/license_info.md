# Biomni Data Source License Information

This document provides an overview of the data sources used by Biomni, their licenses, and suitability for internal hosting and commercial use.

A significant portion of the data used in Biomni requires a commercial license for any commercial application. Several datasets are explicitly licensed for non-commercial use only, which would prohibit their use in a commercial product without a separate agreement. Before proceeding with any commercial use, a thorough legal review of the licenses for each dataset you intend to use is strongly recommended.

## Configuration for Commercial Use

To manage which datasets are used based on licensing, Biomni provides a configuration option. You can set the `commercial_mode` flag to `True` in your configuration to automatically exclude datasets that are not licensed for commercial use.

### Usage

```python
from biomni.agent import A1

# For commercial use (excludes non-commercial datasets)
agent = A1(commercial_mode=True)

# For academic/research use (includes all datasets)
agent = A1(commercial_mode=False)  # default
```

This configuration automatically selects the appropriate data environment description file and ensures compliance with licensing requirements.
