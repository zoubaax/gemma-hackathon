# Deep Visual Proteomics Agent

The **Deep Visual Proteomics Agent** implements the Deep Visual Proteomics (DVP) workflow that combines AI-driven image analysis of cellular phenotypes with automated laser microdissection and ultra-high-sensitivity mass spectrometry. It links protein abundance to complex cellular or subcellular phenotypes while preserving spatial context.

## When to Use This Skill

* When studying spatially-resolved protein expression in tissue sections.
* To link single-cell morphological phenotypes to proteome profiles.
* For identifying cell-type specific protein signatures in heterogeneous tissues.
* When analyzing subcellular proteome compartmentalization.
* To discover spatially-restricted biomarkers in tumor microenvironments.

## Core Capabilities

1. **AI Image Segmentation**: Deep learning models segment cells and identify phenotypes from brightfield, H&E, or immunofluorescence images.

2. **Phenotype Classification**: CNN/transformer classifiers identify cell types, disease states, and morphological abnormalities.

3. **LMD Coordinate Generation**: Automated generation of laser microdissection coordinates for cells of interest.

4. **MS Data Integration**: Processes MaxQuant/DIA-NN output to link protein abundances to spatial coordinates.

5. **Spatial Proteome Mapping**: Creates spatially-resolved proteome maps linking morphology to molecular profiles.

6. **Biologically-Informed Analysis**: Neural networks incorporating pathway knowledge for interpretable biomarker discovery.

## DVP Workflow

```
Tissue Section
     ↓
[AI Image Analysis] → Cell Segmentation → Phenotype Classification
     ↓
[Region Selection] → LMD Coordinates → Automated Microdissection
     ↓
[Sample Processing] → Low-input LC-MS/MS → Proteome Quantification
     ↓
[Data Integration] → Spatial Proteome Map → Pathway Analysis
```

## Example Usage

**User**: "Identify tumor vs. stroma cells in this H&E image and generate proteome profiles for each population."

**Agent Action**:
```bash
python3 Skills/Proteomics/Deep_Visual_Proteomics_Agent/dvp_analyzer.py \
    --image tissue_section.tiff \
    --segmentation cellpose \
    --classifier tumor_stroma_cnn \
    --generate_lmd true \
    --ms_data maxquant_output/ \
    --analysis differential \
    --output dvp_results/
```

## Key Components

| Component | Tool/Method | Description |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|

## Analysis Outputs

1. **Spatial Protein Maps**: Protein abundance overlaid on tissue coordinates
2. **Phenotype-Proteome Links**: Proteins enriched in specific cell types
3. **Pathway Activation**: Spatial patterns of pathway activity
4. **Differential Analysis**: Comparison between regions/phenotypes
5. **Biomarker Candidates**: Spatially-restricted markers

## Biologically-Informed Neural Networks (BINNs)

The agent implements BINNs that integrate:
- A priori knowledge of protein-pathway relationships
- Sparse neural network architecture mirroring biological networks
- Enhanced interpretability for clinical applications
- Validated in septic AKI, COVID-19, and ARDS cohorts
