# ctDNA Dynamics MRD Agent

The **ctDNA Dynamics MRD Agent** provides comprehensive analysis of circulating tumor DNA dynamics for molecular residual disease (MRD) detection, treatment response monitoring, and early relapse prediction. It integrates tumor-informed and tumor-naive approaches with temporal modeling for longitudinal ctDNA analysis.

## When to Use This Skill

* When monitoring minimal/molecular residual disease post-treatment.
* For tracking treatment response through ctDNA kinetics.
* To predict relapse before clinical/radiological detection.
* When assessing tumor burden dynamics during therapy.
* For early detection of acquired resistance mutations.

## Core Capabilities

1. **MRD Detection**: Ultra-sensitive detection of residual disease (LOD 0.001% VAF).

2. **Kinetic Modeling**: Model ctDNA clearance and doubling time.

3. **Response Prediction**: Predict treatment response from early ctDNA dynamics.

4. **Relapse Prediction**: Identify molecular relapse months before imaging.

5. **Resistance Monitoring**: Track emergence of resistance mutations.

6. **Multi-Timepoint Integration**: Analyze longitudinal ctDNA trajectories.

## Detection Approaches

| Approach | Method | LOD | Best Use Case |
|----------|--------|-----|---------------|
| Tumor-Informed | Track known mutations | 0.001% | Post-surgical MRD |
| Tumor-Naive | Panel-based detection | 0.1% | Screening, unknown primary |
| WGS-Based | Fragmentomics + mutations | 0.01% | Comprehensive profiling |
| Methylation | cfDNA methylation | 0.1% | Tissue of origin, early detection |

## Kinetic Parameters

| Parameter | Definition | Clinical Meaning |
|-----------|------------|------------------|
| ctDNA Half-Life | Time to 50% reduction | Treatment sensitivity |
| Doubling Time | Time to 2x increase | Tumor growth rate |
| Nadir | Lowest ctDNA level | Depth of response |
| Time to Nadir | Days to reach nadir | Response kinetics |
| Clearance Rate | Exponential decay constant | Treatment efficacy |
| Lead Time | MRD+ to clinical relapse | Early detection window |

## Workflow

1. **Input**: Serial ctDNA measurements (VAF or copies/mL), timepoints, treatment dates.

2. **QC**: Assess sequencing quality, coverage, tumor fraction.

3. **Mutation Tracking**: Quantify tracked variants across timepoints.

4. **Kinetic Modeling**: Fit exponential/sigmoidal models to dynamics.

5. **MRD Calling**: Determine MRD status with confidence intervals.

6. **Resistance Detection**: Identify emerging resistant clones.

7. **Output**: MRD status, kinetic parameters, predictions, visualizations.

## Example Usage

**User**: "Analyze this patient's serial ctDNA data to assess MRD status and predict relapse risk."

## Special Considerations

1. **Tumor Fraction**: Low tumor fraction limits sensitivity
2. **Pre-Analytical**: Plasma processing affects cfDNA quality
3. **Clonal Hematopoiesis**: CHIP variants can confound results
4. **Panel Design**: Ensure sufficient mutation coverage
5. **Timing**: Sample timing relative to treatment critical
