## Version Compatibility

Reference examples tested with: MACS3 3.0+, clusterProfiler 4.10+

Before using code patterns, verify installed versions match. If versions differ:
- R: `packageVersion('<pkg>')` then `?function_name` to verify parameters

If code throws ImportError, AttributeError, or TypeError, introspect the installed
package and adapt the example to match the actual API rather than retrying.

# Peak Annotation with ChIPseeker

**"Annotate my ChIP-seq peaks to genes"** → Assign peaks to genomic features (promoter, exon, intron, intergenic), find nearest genes, and calculate TSS distances.
- R: `ChIPseeker::annotatePeak(peaks, TxDb=txdb)`

## Load Peaks and Annotations

```r
library(ChIPseeker)
library(TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38.knownGene)
library(org.Hs.eg.db)

txdb <- TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38.knownGene

# Read peaks from MACS3
peaks <- readPeakFile('sample_peaks.narrowPeak')
```

## Annotate Peaks

**Goal:** Assign each ChIP-seq peak to its nearest gene and genomic feature category.

**Approach:** Use annotatePeak with a TxDb annotation database to classify peaks as promoter, exon, intron, or intergenic and retrieve the nearest gene symbol.

```r
# Annotate with default settings
peak_anno <- annotatePeak(
    peaks,
    TxDb = txdb,
    annoDb = 'org.Hs.eg.db'
)

# View annotation summary
peak_anno
```

## Custom Promoter Definition

```r
# Define promoter region (-3kb to +3kb from TSS)
peak_anno <- annotatePeak(
    peaks,
    TxDb = txdb,
    tssRegion = c(-3000, 3000),  # Promoter definition
    annoDb = 'org.Hs.eg.db'
)
```

## Extract Annotated Data Frame

```r
# Convert to data frame
anno_df <- as.data.frame(peak_anno)

# Key columns: seqnames, start, end, annotation, distanceToTSS, SYMBOL, GENENAME
head(anno_df)

# Export to CSV
write.csv(anno_df, 'annotated_peaks.csv', row.names = FALSE)
```

## Get Genes with Peaks in Promoter

```r
# Filter for promoter peaks
promoter_peaks <- anno_df[grep('Promoter', anno_df$annotation), ]

# Get unique genes
promoter_genes <- unique(promoter_peaks$SYMBOL)
```

## Annotation Pie Chart

```r
# Pie chart of genomic feature distribution
plotAnnoPie(peak_anno)

# Bar plot alternative
plotAnnoBar(peak_anno)
```

## Distance to TSS Plot

```r
# Distribution of peaks relative to TSS
plotDistToTSS(peak_anno, title = 'Distribution of peaks relative to TSS')
```

## Compare Multiple Peak Sets

**Goal:** Compare genomic feature distributions across multiple ChIP-seq experiments (e.g., different histone marks).

**Approach:** Read and annotate each peak file separately, then use plotAnnoBar and plotDistToTSS on the annotation list for side-by-side comparison.

```r
# Read multiple peak files
peak_files <- list(
    H3K4me3 = 'H3K4me3_peaks.narrowPeak',
    H3K27ac = 'H3K27ac_peaks.narrowPeak',
    H3K27me3 = 'H3K27me3_peaks.broadPeak'
)

peak_list <- lapply(peak_files, readPeakFile)

# Annotate all
anno_list <- lapply(peak_list, annotatePeak, TxDb = txdb, annoDb = 'org.Hs.eg.db')

# Compare annotations
plotAnnoBar(anno_list)
plotDistToTSS(anno_list)
```

## Venn Diagram of Peak Overlap

```r
# Find overlapping peaks
genes_list <- lapply(anno_list, function(x) as.data.frame(x)$SYMBOL)
vennplot(genes_list)
```

## Coverage Plot

```r
# Plot peak coverage around TSS
covplot(peaks, weightCol = 'V5')  # V5 is score column in narrowPeak
```

## Profile Heatmap Around TSS

**Goal:** Visualize the distribution of ChIP-seq signal around transcription start sites.

**Approach:** Extract promoter regions from the TxDb, build a tag matrix of signal at those regions, and plot as a heatmap or average profile.

```r
# Get promoter coordinates
promoter <- getPromoters(TxDb = txdb, upstream = 3000, downstream = 3000)

# Get tag matrix
tagMatrix <- getTagMatrix(peaks, windows = promoter)

# Plot heatmap
tagHeatmap(tagMatrix, xlim = c(-3000, 3000), color = 'red')

# Average profile
plotAvgProf(tagMatrix, xlim = c(-3000, 3000), xlab = 'Distance from TSS')
```

## Functional Enrichment of Peak Genes

**Goal:** Determine which biological processes are enriched among genes with ChIP-seq peaks in their promoters.

**Approach:** Extract Entrez IDs from annotated peaks and run GO enrichment analysis with clusterProfiler.

```r
library(clusterProfiler)

# Get genes from peaks
genes <- unique(anno_df$ENTREZID)

# GO enrichment
ego <- enrichGO(
    gene = genes,
    OrgDb = org.Hs.eg.db,
    ont = 'BP',
    pAdjustMethod = 'BH',
    pvalueCutoff = 0.05
)
```

## Seq2Gene - All Genes in Peak Regions

```r
# Find all genes overlapping peak regions (not just nearest)
genes_in_peaks <- seq2gene(peaks, tssRegion = c(-1000, 1000), flankDistance = 3000, TxDb = txdb)
```

## Different Organisms

```r
# Mouse
library(TxDb.Mmusculus.UCSC.mm10.knownGene)
library(org.Mm.eg.db)
peak_anno_mm <- annotatePeak(peaks, TxDb = TxDb.Mmusculus.UCSC.mm10.knownGene, annoDb = 'org.Mm.eg.db')

# Zebrafish
library(TxDb.Drerio.UCSC.danRer11.refGene)
library(org.Dr.eg.db)
```
