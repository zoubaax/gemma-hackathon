# Batch Design Usage Guide

## Overview

This guide covers designing experiments to minimize batch effects and assigning samples to batches optimally.

## Prerequisites

```r
# R/Bioconductor
install.packages('BiocManager')
BiocManager::install(c('sva', 'limma'))

# Optional for design optimization
install.packages('designit')
```

## Quick Start

Tell your AI agent what you want to do:
- "Help me assign 24 samples to 3 sequencing batches"
- "Check if my experimental design is balanced"
- "Detect batch effects in my RNA-seq data"
- "Create a balanced plate layout for my samples"

## Example Prompts

### Experimental Design

> "I have 12 treated and 12 control samples. Help me assign them to 3 batches to minimize confounding"

> "Design a balanced layout for 48 samples across 6 plates with 2 conditions and 2 timepoints"

### Batch Detection

> "Check my RNA-seq data for batch effects and suggest corrections"

> "Estimate how many hidden batches might be in my data using SVA"

### Documentation

> "Create a sample tracking sheet for my multi-batch experiment"

## What the Agent Will Do

1. Assess study design for potential confounding
2. Create balanced batch assignments
3. Generate randomization schemes
4. Identify existing batch effects in data
5. Recommend appropriate correction methods

## Tips

- Never run all treated samples in one batch
- Balance all known covariates (sex, age, condition) across batches
- Include technical replicates across batches when possible
- Document everything: dates, operators, reagent lots
- If batches are unavoidable, ensure they're correctable
- Consider batch in your statistical model during analysis
