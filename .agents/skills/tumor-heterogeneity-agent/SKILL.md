# Tumor Heterogeneity Agent

The **Tumor Heterogeneity Agent** provides comprehensive analysis of intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) for understanding clonal architecture, tracking subclonal evolution, and predicting therapy resistance. It integrates multi-region sequencing, single-cell data, and longitudinal samples to reconstruct tumor phylogenies and identify actionable subclones.

## When to Use This Skill

* When analyzing multi-region tumor sequencing for clonal architecture.
* For tracking clonal evolution under treatment pressure.
* To predict resistance emergence from subclonal populations.
* When assessing tumor heterogeneity impact on treatment response.
* For integrating single-cell and bulk sequencing for ITH analysis.

## Core Capabilities

1. **Clonal Deconvolution**: Infer clonal populations and their frequencies.

2. **Phylogeny Reconstruction**: Build tumor evolutionary trees from variants.

3. **Subclonal Tracking**: Monitor subclone dynamics over time.

4. **Resistance Prediction**: Identify pre-existing resistant subclones.

5. **Multi-Region Integration**: Combine spatial heterogeneity data.

6. **Single-Cell ITH**: Integrate scDNA-seq for ground-truth clones.

## Heterogeneity Metrics

| Metric | Definition | Clinical Relevance |
|--------|------------|-------------------|
| MATH Score | Mutant-allele tumor heterogeneity | ITH quantification |
| Shannon Index | Clonal diversity | Evolutionary potential |
| Clone Count | Number of distinct clones | Complexity |
| Truncal Fraction | % truncal mutations | Targetability |
| ITH Score | Composite heterogeneity | Prognosis |

## Workflow

1. **Input**: Multi-region/longitudinal WES/WGS, copy number, tumor purity.

2. **Preprocessing**: Variant calling, CNV calling, purity estimation.

3. **CCF Estimation**: Calculate cancer cell fraction for each mutation.

4. **Clustering**: Group mutations into clonal populations.

5. **Phylogeny**: Reconstruct evolutionary tree.

6. **Temporal Analysis**: Track clone dynamics over time.

7. **Output**: Clone structures, phylogenies, heterogeneity metrics.

## Example Usage

**User**: "Analyze the clonal architecture of this multi-region lung tumor sequencing to understand heterogeneity and identify resistant subclones."

**Agent Action**:
```bash
python3 Skills/Oncology/Tumor_Heterogeneity_Agent/ith_analysis.py \
    --multi_region_vcfs region1.vcf,region2.vcf,region3.vcf \
    --cnv_segments cnv_calls.seg \
    --purity 0.7,0.65,0.72 \
    --sample_names Primary,Met1,Met2 \
    --method pyclone-vi \
    --phylogeny_method citup \
    --output ith_analysis/
```

|-----------|-------|----------|
| Fish Plot | Clone dynamics over time | Longitudinal |
| Tree Diagram | Branching evolution | Multi-region |
| Muller Plot | Population dynamics | Treatment response |
| Clone Map | Spatial distribution | Multi-region spatial |

## Special Considerations

1. **Sampling Bias**: Multi-region captures more heterogeneity
2. **Purity Effects**: Low purity reduces clone resolution
3. **CNV Complexity**: High CNV burden complicates CCF
4. **Single-Cell Validation**: Ground truth from scDNA-seq
5. **Temporal Resolution**: Frequent sampling improves tracking

|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| Pre-existing resistant clone | Subclonal at baseline | Combination therapy |
| Acquired resistance | New clone emerges | Switch therapy |
| Phenotypic plasticity | Expression change | Monitor phenotype |
| Microenvironment | TME evolution | Immunotherapy |
